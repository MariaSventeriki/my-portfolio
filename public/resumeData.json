    "bio":"Born and raised in Greece, living in Germany for the last 5 years. After exprerimenting with theater and technology i decided to pursue programming and keep acting as a hobby. I am currently doing one year intensive course in Full-Stack Web Development, in Digital Career Institute in Berlin Germany. My prior studies in Cultural Technology and communication,broadened my knowledge and opened my mind, but the current pandemic pursuaded me to deepen and specify my knowledge in the field of programming. I always said to myself that this is not for me, well... i was wrong!",
